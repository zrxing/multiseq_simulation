Warning message:
In estimateDispersionsFit(object, fitType = fitType, quiet = quiet) :
  the parametric fit of dispersion estimates over the mean of counts
failed, which occurs when the trend is not well captured by the
function y = a/x + b. A local regression fit is automatically performed,
and the analysis can continue. You can specify fitType='local' or 'mean'
to avoid this message if re-running the same data.
When using local regression fit, the user should examine plotDispEsts(dds)
to make sure the fitted line is not sharply curving up or down based on
the position of individual points.
